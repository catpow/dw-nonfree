All development goes on in the `develop` branch. `master` is only around so
you can read this README explaining that `master` doesn't really exist here.

But we'd love to have you onboard! See [our wiki](http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
for more information. You might want to begin with
[the Dev Getting Started page](http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Dev_Getting_Started).
